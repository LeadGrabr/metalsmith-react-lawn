For years, fall leaves have been an annoyance since I had to handle the massive amounts of falling foliage. If you live in a green area densely packed with trees, you know what I am talking about. Frequently, it includes back breaking work to rake leaves, remove fallen twigs and branches, and a good garbage bag to pick up all the junk brought to your yard by mother nature's good old wind! 

The burden of doing this work is not a worry to me now. Ever since I visited Lawn and Garden Professionals of Ann Arbor, their services have taken the load off my back - literally! What I can say to you is that when you hire them and the job is successfully completed, you can also count on them again for regular maintenance. A crew will come every Spring and Fall for a seasonal cleanup. Your floral display will be changed, and all your trees, shrubs and perennials will be fertilized. Bed revitalization programs will be applied, using top quality mulching. Your dream garden will always look at its best, and who knows... maybe someday it will also be featured on the front cover of a gardening magazine, like mine!
