In Michigan, the temperatures can begin to fall quickly in different parts of Ann Arbor, Canton, and Ypsilanti. It then becomes time for your annual Fall care therapies to begin. Your yard has been lush, mowed, and green all summer and has seen some barbecues and many other gatherings. It's time for your lawn to do some changing and you need to help it into the next stage.

Maintaining landscape in Ann Arbor is especially challenging for multiple reasons. In Michigan, the hot summers are one of the main reasons why it's hard to keep your flowers and plants looking beautiful all year long. Experienced landscapers in the Washtenaw area will make sure you have the right plants and flowers installed from the beginning. Planting flowers that have the best chance of making it through the 90+ degree weather is always important, but it would be prudent of you to do some research on the best plants to grow in Michigan and ask the landscaper their professional opinion.

Fall may be the time you stop mowing and watering your lawn. On the contrary, your lawn still requires the proper maintenance albeit not as much. The Fall lawn care required will heavily depend on your region - Ann Arbor may not need the same care as Canton, for example.

As Fall turns into Winter, the colors of the leaves begin to change. The plants that require rest start to enter their hibernation mode and growth slows. As the plants move into the next season, they still need fertilization and some water to get them to the next point. That means Fall is your best time to do some cleanup and maintenance. From mowing to fertilizing, we can do another full maintenance program in your yard. We'll pull weeds and trim your hedges to prepare the plants for winter. And, of course, one of the most notable things we can do as part of your Fall lawn care is to fertilize.

There are many great fertilizer products on the market today. If you don't want to infuse a ton of chemicals, there are homemade fertilizers that you can use as well. The point is to give your lawn another meal before it hits the hay, so to speak.

The best fertilizer to use would preferably be one that offers a slow or controlled release of nutrients. This way, the nourishment is not used all at once but throughout the next season. Taking this extra step isn't necessarily going to keep your lawn green, but it will maintain the grass stimulated until Spring.

Earlier in the Fall season, using a fertilizer with the NPK of a 3:1:2 or a 4:1:2 help maintain your hard work from the past Spring and Summer. These ratios are just suggestions. They are not as high as what you needed in the Spring however it's sufficient until it's time to winterize your lawn.

Besides fertilizing, this is also the time to kill those weeds. We all know that pesky weeds manage to survive through almost any condition. If you can get rid of them now, winterizing will be much simpler. 

Thatching your lawn is also an important step which removes the dead and mulched grass from your weekly mowing. By thatching your yard, you'll give more oxygen to the soil which allows the grass a jump start the following Spring.

Another part of Fall lawn care is to plant new seed and establish it for Spring. Typically, in the Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, and general southeast Michigan locations, mid-August and September is a good time to do this process. When weeds grow slower, grass can grow faster.

It is certainly a wonder how the trees and plants know when it's time to relax and prepare for the colder months ahead. We have enjoyed nature all year, and now it's time to give back and allow our yards to recoup.
