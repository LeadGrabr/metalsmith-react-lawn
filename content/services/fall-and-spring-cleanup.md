## Why clean up your lawn before the fall?

Many people neglect proper lawn care in Spring, thinking that preparation is easier left until later on in the season. Delaying your lawn care and Spring cleanup is one of the biggest mistakes that many homeowners make. Proper lawn care can begin right after the last frost so that the soil can get ready for the warmer weather to provide a lush and healthy lawn. Despite the type of winter season that the garden had to endure, it's important to remember that lawns and gardens are simply more vulnerable at this stage and require tender loving care to produce sound stages of growth for the warmer months. It's also important to start the lawn on a healthy path so that it will be able to defend against common pests and diseases that many poorly maintained lawns succumb to. To make the most of the coming months, we have several tips on Dos and Dont's for your Spring cleanup. Pay close attention, they are the most common things that people either forget to do or go overboard doing, which leads to less than ideal conditions for the lawns and gardens.

## Tips and Tricks for Fall and Spring Cleanup

### Do Get Rid of Snow

Many people shovel snow into piles which take longer times to melt once warmer Spring weather sets in. Try to disperse the snow so that it can melt faster and to give the grass or plants underneath a chance to recover and gain nutrients from the sun. Avoid salting areas on or near lawns and gardens since it will significantly affect the soil underneath. Also, try to avoid ripping the snow/ice away from the grass since it will most likely tear out chunks of the lawn and plants underneath.

### Do Not Fertilize in Excess

One thing that many people believe for fertilizer is "the more, the better." Unfortunately, over fertilizing a lawn is one of the top reasons lawns and gardens do not grow as lush and healthy as owners would like. By over fertilizing, the soil becomes saturated with the nitrogen, creating a less than ideal environment for new grass and plants to grow in. Always consider adding fertilizer during the season so that the nutrients can be dispersed evenly throughout the entire growth period.

### Do Overseed

Most lawns will not survive the winter season without some amount of damage or missing patches of grass. One of the top tips for lawn care in Spring is to overseed the lawn. By over-seeding some of the thinner and bare spots, they will fill out the emptiness and create a richer looking yard that stays healthy throughout the season. Make sure to seed evenly and add a little extra in the areas that need it most.

### Do Not Forget Water

Always remember to water regularly, especially after seeding the lawn. For the first two to three weeks after seeding, it's important for the lawn to get ample water and sunlight so that the seeds can properly germinate. Watering your lawn ensures the best start for a beautiful front yard that everyone can enjoy.
