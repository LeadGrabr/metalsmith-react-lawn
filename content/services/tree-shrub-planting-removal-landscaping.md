# Tree & Shrub Planting And Removal

Some of our customers want their gardens to be brightened up with trees and flowering shrubs. Others have the opposite problem – they need trees or shrubs to be removed! 

## Planting Trees and Shrubs: a BIG Decision

Choosing trees and shrubs for your garden and finding the right places to plant them may not sound like a big decision, but it is! Here’s why:

* Trees and shrubs are “permanent” features.
* They form the framework for your garden.
* It’s all too easy to overplant or to plant them in the wrong places.
* Poorly located and poorly chosen plants can damage structures.


If your garden were a series of outdoor rooms, the trees and shrubs would form the walls and ceilings. There’s a lot more to choosing and siting your trees and shrubs than you may ever have realized.

We’ll help you to find the right plants for your garden, and we’ll get them off to the best possible start.

## Great Garden Design Starts Here

Even if you’re quite a keen gardener, it’s wise to get professional help with tree and shrub planting. We’ll ensure you get nothing but joy from your plants and your garden. It’s easy for you to move the occasional ground cover or perennial, but a tree or shrub in the wrong place is a problem that’s much harder to rectify.

## Why Trees and Shrubs Sometimes Have to Go

There are many reasons why people find themselves asking us to remove trees or shrubs. Usually, by the time they approach us, they’re at their wits’ end. They feel bad about having to remove the plants, but they also can’t continue to live with them.

This often happens as a result of overplanting or not using foresight when selecting a space for shrubs and trees. Plants that were poor quality when they left the nursery may have been chosen – a bad start that often can’t be overcome and can even prove dangerous! Weak branches falling off trees cause property damage and may even kill.

### Our services include:
* Safe tree-felling and shrub removal.
* Stump grinding to remove the tree-stumps.
* Full garden refuse removal / chipping (if you want to keep the chips)


## Feeling confined?

If you feel like the princess in “Sleeping Beauty” who was hidden away and confined by a wild mass of impenetrable bush, it’s high time you called us. We’ll identify what needs to go – shrubs that block walkways, trees that threaten roofs and so on.

We’ll also help you to decide what should stay, after all, you don’t want us to clear away absolutely everything! When we’re done, you’ll have more space and more light in your garden – and absolutely no mess to clear away.
