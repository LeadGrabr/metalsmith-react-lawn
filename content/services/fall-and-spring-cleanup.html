Many people neglect proper lawn care in Spring, thinking that preparation is easier left until later on in the season. Delaying your lawn care and Spring cleanup is one of the biggest mistakes that many homeowners make. Proper lawn care can begin right after the last frost so that the soil can get ready for the warmer weather to provide a lush and healthy lawn.

Despite the type of winter season that the garden had to endure, it's important to remember that lawns and gardens are simply more vulnerable at this stage and require tender loving care to produce sound stages of growth for the warmer months. It's also important to start the lawn on a healthy path so that it will be able to defend against common pests and diseases that many poorly maintained lawns succumb to.

To make the most of the coming months, we have several tips on Dos and Dont's for your Spring cleanup. Pay close attention, they are the most common things that people either forget to do or go overboard doing, which leads to less than ideal conditions for the lawns and gardens.

Do Get Rid of Snow

Many people shovel snow into piles which take longer times to melt once warmer Spring weather sets in. Try to disperse the snow so that it can melt faster and to give the grass or plants underneath a chance to recover and gain nutrients from the sun. Avoid salting areas on or near lawns and gardens since it will significantly affect the soil underneath. Also, try to avoid ripping the snow/ice away from the grass since it will most likely tear out chunks of the lawn and plants underneath.

Do Not Fertilize in Excess

One thing that many people believe for fertilizer is "the more, the better." Unfortunately, over fertilizing a lawn is one of the top reasons lawns and gardens do not grow as lush and healthy as owners would like. By over fertilizing, the soil becomes saturated with the nitrogen, creating a less than ideal environment for new grass and plants to grow in. Always consider adding fertilizer during the season so that the nutrients can be dispersed evenly throughout the entire growth period.

Do Overseed

Most lawns will not survive the winter season without some amount of damage or missing patches of grass. One of the top tips for lawn care in Spring is to overseed the lawn. By over-seeding some of the thinner and bare spots, they will fill out the emptiness and create a richer looking yard that stays healthy throughout the season. Make sure to seed evenly and add a little extra in the areas that need it most.

Do Not Forget Water

Always remember to water regularly, especially after seeding the lawn. For the first two to three weeks after seeding, it's important for the lawn to get ample water and sunlight so that the seeds can properly germinate. Watering your lawn ensures the best start for a beautiful front yard that everyone can enjoy.

For yard lovers and homeowners, Spring is a great time to get outside, enjoy the outdoors, and revitalize your lawn. After a long hard Winter, your garden deserves all the help it can get.

1: Try to loosen up the soil. 
Throughout the Winter grass roots are under a lot of stress. Lawn aeration can be done using a mechanical aeration or a liquid lawn aerator. Loosening the soil by aerating your lawn reduces stress and helps the yard to spring back - pun intended. Liquid aeration opens up a path to the roots system for easier absorption of water, air, and nutrients. One proven liquid loosens clays and hard soils naturally and efficiently. Made with a grade A ground penetrate, it penetrates the soil and has humic acid which breaks down harmful pesticides and herbicides into the ground.

2: After using a mechanical or liquid aerator, the next thing to do is over-seed any bare spots you have in the lawn. For best results, use a thin layer of peat moss and keep the seed and seedling moist for the first four weeks. Top quality seeds are usually worth the few extra bucks because they are more drought resistant, traffic-resistant, and look nicer.

3: Lawn Thatching helps to rid of unwanted grasses, moss and dead grass material in the yard. Thatching with a power rake is ideal, but a hand rake works in a pinch as well. After removing unwanted grass thatch, the lawn can flourish and do much better.

4: Fertilization. In early Spring, we recommend a fertilizer high in nitrogen, but with little or no phosphorous. A fertilizer containing urea or other types of long lasting nitrogen may be ideal. Healthy lawns are more resistant to weeds, droughts, and pests. Long lasting fertilizers are less likely to burn your lawn. Fertilization and over seeding are a great compliment to mechanical and liquid aeration and thatching.
