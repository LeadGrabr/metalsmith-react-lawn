	{
		"question": "Do you prune trees and hedges? What about tree felling?",
		"answer": "Healthy trees are an important part of your garden, but sometimes trees can become a problem, blocking out sunshine, disturbing building foundations or obscuring views. We can help. Hedges need frequent clipping to keep them in shape and to keep the growth dense from top to bottom. "
	},
	{
		"question": "Do you maintain beds and edges?",

	},
	{
		"question": "Can I ask you to clean out my gutters too?",

	},
	{
